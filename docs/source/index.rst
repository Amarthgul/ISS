Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

Geometric optics here is largely built upon the concept of ray batch, a form of representation similar to rays in ray tracing but with additional entries for the physical-based simulation. 

{math}`\mathbf{r}=\left(  x,\\ y, \\ z, \\ v _x, \\ v _y, \\ v _z, \\ \lambda, \\ \Phi, \\ i _{\Phi}, \\ s, \\ b _s \right) ^T`

Inline embeding attempt: {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
