Implicit Optical System Simulation. 

This project aims to establish a way to digitize lenses with physical accuracy for media production use, such as VFX live action matching or adding accurate optical characteristics in animated film.

Additionally, it may also be used to deconvolute images for information reconstruction, and in some cases, historical preservation of optics.
